He didn't know why they were there... but they were.
The top of the appartment building was dark. The six figures faced each other, three to a side.
Lightning struck in the background and it began to rain.
He was very nervous as this was his first rehearsal with the Famous Clown Club. He did not want to mess up this opportunity to follow his dream job.
He looked to his left. Fear. He looked to his right. Madness. 
His heart began to beat louder and LOUDER...until he couldn't take it anymore.

Bozo, looked at his feet. Yup, size 46 was the wrong size for today.
He inspected his umbrella. Long black handle and a rainbow top. Everything was set.
He grinned and started to run towards the edge of the building.

He ran so fast until he reached the edge, then jumped into the night sky and started to fly. Yes fly! this is what made the Famous clown club so popular with audiences and circuses alike. They put on a great show and saved their employers on transportation costs.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the best way to run a business.
